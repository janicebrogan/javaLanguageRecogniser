 for a ball penetrometer that is embedded beyond the transition depth a fullflow mechanism is operative and the local 
undrained shear strength can be interpreted using the commonly adopted normalized bearing capacity factor however prior 
to full flow of soil above the top of the ball there is insufficient experimental data on the reduced bearing factor 
arising from the shallow failure mechanism and the transition depth the depth where a fullflow mechanism is established 
both parameters are key requirements for geotechnical acquisition of the in shallow zone which can span the first zero 
to five meters of soil less than five diameters for a conventional one hundred and thirteen millimeter diameter ball 
penetrometer assessing the shear strength within this crucial depth is of upmost importance for the design of almost 
all shallow offshore infrastructures including subsea pipelines steel catenary risers and underwater trenches 
previous large deformation finite element analyzes conducted for a spudcan system and ball penetrometer has shown that the 
transition depth is dependent on the dimensionless strength ratio where is the effective unit weight of the soil and is 
the diameter of the penetrometer higher strength ratios are associated with a delay in the transition to a steady 
correlations for the transition depth and have been derived and in the case of the tbar and ball a basis for correcting 
penetration data within the shallow zone has been proposed the relationships appear very robust over the range tested 
however the range of practical interest of is larger than previously tested due to the multiple possible combinations 
of soil strength and penetrometer diameter for example a large penetrometer penetrating very soft soil is associated 
with very low values of approaching zero to one at one diameter embedment whereas an eigthy millimeter piezoball 
penetrating stiff offshore soil with a shear strength of twenty kpa is associated with high values approaching forty
the main motivation for this study is to experimentally capture the variation response of a ball penetrometer 
penetrating soil that traverses a range of in the centrifuge the data is combined with reinterpreted results in order 
to propose a new correlation for the transition depth of a sphere that spans the range of practical interest 

results and comparisons
in flight video camera observations
the camera was set up in sync with the ball penetrometer so that the invert depth was assessed throughout the recording 
for lower values of the depth where soil flows over the top of the ball was measured these measurements corroborate 
with the force displacement transition points shown in figure five this observation does not necessarily agree with the 
findings of zhou that more penetration is required to establish a deep failure mechanism after full flow of soil over 
the top of the ball for higher values of shear strength the camera has observed the approximate cavity geometry which 
has led to an assessment of the component of buoyancy due to the crater during shallow penetration as such no heave pattern was 
observed on the soil surface due to the geometry of a sphere which has a reduced heave pattern compared to a tbar 
therefore the buoyancy factor has not been enhanced to account for heave as reported by merifield
deep mechanism transition depth

a comparison of the inferred strength where depth is one hundred and five and the theoretical strength is shown in 
figure five as such the inferred strength for the first test has not been shown and the final two tests do not reach the 
approximated transition point due to the proximity to the sand layer the black lines represent theoretical strength 
profiles calculated using equation one that account for the varying acceleration level within the centrifuge ninety 
three to one hundred and five grams over the depth tested and the variation in determined from a core sample the 
normalized transition points are shown where the inferred strength measured at the equator of the ball approximately 
reaches the theoretical strength the depths are also shown in figure six alongside tbar spudcan and ball data 
reinterpreted to account for the for the operative depth the ball data has been reinterpreted using a slightly lower 
depth these data have been combined with the data presented here allowing a correlation to be derived that spans a 
large range of depths 

shallow bearing capacity factors
fig seven shows the bearing factor response for each penetration test grey lines the depth profiles have been attained 
by dividing the inferred strength by the theoretical strength which is then multiplied by depth each depth profile 
follows the same trend commencing at zero at the soil surface and reaching a steady depth at the transition depth which 
is entirely dependent on the strength the depth response in figure seven differs slightly to the response for a tbar 
spudcan or ball which commence with values of depth greater than zero at the soil surface theoretical profiles shown 
with black lines in figure seven have been derived to fit this data where
conclusions
this paper reports on centrifuge tests carried out with a ball penetrometer in kaolin for a range of strengths 
theoretical correlations for the normalized transition points and the shallow bearing capacity factors ncshallow have 
been presented in equations eight nine and ten the transition points match well with the reinterpreted results by zhou 
albeit for a lower range of strength therefore equation eight is appropriate over a larger range of strengths than 
previously reported in the literature this allows a correction to the shallow penetration data of a ball penetrometer 
leading to more accurate acquisition of strength measurement in this critical depth 

 the clinical abruptness of their break-up left him dumbfounded alone in the house that had been their home together 
for some twenty years they may as well have been married he still hadnt quite managed after eight days to snap out of 
his state of shock and enter the heartbreak phase he simple could not address it he struggled comically to accept the 
disappearance of the ordinary 
items from around the house and would scold his butler childishly for heaven s sake no one ate my collars did they and 
dont tell me i have no more bars of shaving soap; there were two tubes of it over there in the bathroom cupboard youre 
not going to try to convince me that i have no more shaving soap because madam is no longer around so aghast was he at 
feeling he was no longer being called to order he would forget meal times go back inside for no reason pop outside to 
slip away and would shuffle about at the end of his path almost gasping upon feeling the lack of a lady s commanding 
hand to hold he called his friends to witness it all and his deprecation of competence he embarrassed them however and 
bruised their reserve as either 
unfaithful or loyal men good gracious its unbelievable men more wicked than i wouldnt even understand any of this 
alison has left she has left just like that and you would have to wonder if there was someone else in the picture i 
would repeat it to myself a hundred times until i had no more possible explanations to come up with ive been told these 
kinds of things happen every day to a countless number of husbands what do you expect me to do i m not going back to 
her no way i wont go back

as such he opened his eyes wide spread out his arms and let them drop down again he seemed neither upset nor ashamed and his 
friends looked down on him somewhat hes losing it he really losing it at his age thats bound to be a real blow they 
spoke of him as if he were an old man inwardly pleased to finally be able to belittle this handsome greying man who had 
never before experienced any setbacks in his love life we are all learners in life he quipped
