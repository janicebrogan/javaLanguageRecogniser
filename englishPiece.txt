by the late nineteen sixties the economic political and social value of french knowledge was gaining much 
recognition throughout the rest of canada largely owing to actions taken by canadas federal government for example 
the provision of funds for bilingual program evaluation and dissemination of information on their outcomes 
the development of federal identity programs spread to other parts of canada after news spread of the program in 
quebec the program described above termed early total immersion was the one that was most commonly introduced 
elsewhere but format variations eg early partial immersion programs from grade one onwards approximately half the school 
day is taught in the first language and half in the second language mid immersion programs which start at grade 
four or five and late immersion programs which start at grade six or seven in most cases french is taught as a subject 
prior to mid or late immersion program participation were also implemented due to administrative or parental concerns 
about sufficient first language skills development as well as how much content would be learned and how much french the 
students would learn in these programs there are currently approx three hundred thousand students enrolled in a federal 
identity program

liddicoat learning the culture of interpersonal relationships students understandings of personal address forms in french 
intercultural pragmatics the pronominal address system is particularly difficult for learners whose first language does not 
feature an equivalent 
address system for example native english speakers who must first comprehend the very concept of this system before coming to 
understand its practical applications in variety of cultural contexts adding a further dimension of complexity to formal and 
informal usage of second person address for second language learners is that in reality its use isnt confined neatly to the 
two usage conventions that are typically taught to second language learners formality and politeness liddicoat 


as such liddicoat believes that upon achieving sociolinguistic competence second language learners must understand the way in 
which interpersonal relationships are represented through french that is their formation and expression through the french language 
as well as also having to learn the various conventions and contextual applications of the address system liddicoat
