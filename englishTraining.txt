 it had already been recognized by the mid nineteen sixties that in order for the economic survival of quebec in canada 
a high level of proficiency in french among the english speaking population was necessary at that time french was the 
provinces official language and the majority of the population spoke french but many of its english speakers had a poor 
knowledge of french despite many having studied french in school it did not equip them with the skills required to work 
and socialize in french as it was only taught in small doses with a focus on drills memorization and grammar in attempt 
to remedy the situation by improving the teaching of french as a second language a group of parents in saint lambert 
quebec having consulted experts in bilingualim at mcgill university proposed to their school board a program whereby 
from the first day of school unilingual english speaking children would receive instruction entirely in french first 
learning to read in french and in later grades learning first language literacy skills as well as other subjects 
through the medium of lone thus by grade six approximately half the curriculum would be taught in the first language 
and half in the second language

by the late nineteen sixties the economic political and social value of french knowledge was gaining much 
recognition throughout the rest of canada largely owing to actions taken by canadas federal government for example 
the provision of funds for bilingual program evaluation and dissemination of information on their outcomes 
the development of federal identity programs spread to other parts of canada after news spread of the program in 
quebec the program described above termed early total immersion was the one that was most commonly introduced 
elsewhere but format variations eg early partial immersion programs from grade one onwards approximately half the school 
day is taught in the first language and half in the second language mid immersion programs which start at grade 
four or five and late immersion programs which start at grade six or seven in most cases french is taught as a subject 
prior to mid or late immersion program participation were also implemented due to administrative or parental concerns 
about sufficient first language skills development as well as how much content would be learned and how much french the 
students would learn in these programs there are currently approx three hundred thousand students enrolled in a federal 
identity program

initial experimentation harley day shapson and lyster did not attempt to isolate the effects of a single variable on 
second language learning on the assumption that factors such as greater and more focused opportunities for output and 
increased salience and frequency in the input would together produce enhancing effects later studies lapierre swain 
lapkin tried to isolate the effect of output on second language learning

the harley study focussed on the distinction between the past verb tenses and found that the 
experimental classes outperformed the comparison classes in speaking but not in writing day shapson focussed on the 
use of the conditional verb tense found that the experimental outperformed comparison classes in composition writing 
and cloze test but not in speaking and lyster concerned with socio linguistic appropriateness particularly the 
appropriate usage of formal and informal you found that the experimental classes outperformed the comparison classes 
in recognizing contextually appropriate french studies are significant for their attempts to develop curriculum 
materials the focus on form in such a way that it is integrated with the learning of content ie grammar is thus not 
isolated from context or meaning the approach taken in these studies differ from krashens theory in relation to second 
language learning that production is an outcome of learning rather than a source of learning and that explicit grammar 
teaching is of little use in second language acquisition

lysters study was concerned with socio linguistic appropriateness particularly the appropriate usage of formal and 
informal you address forms linguistic weaknesses that had previously been identified by evaluations and observations 
of immersion teachers and researchers lyster conducted these studies at grade six seven and eight

the day shapson curriculum unit designed to be used in fixed length periods per week over a period of five to six weeks 
focussed on the use of the conditional in hypothetical situations and in polite requests

in general there was a lack of consistent or great differences between the groups in the findings of these studies the 
researchers attributed this to problems that arose in the implementation of instructional material in the studies which 
could be remedied in future studies

even though the overall instructional approach was effective in these studies it is impossible to determine which 
aspects of the instruction contributed to learning while it might not be necessary to isolate the effects of a single 
variable on language learning it is pertinent from a theoretical perspective the role of student output in particular 
in second language learning has been highlighted by pedagogical and theoretical developments stemming from the 
identification of the lack of student output in immersion classes particularly in relation to extended discourse this 
role of output on second language learning was investigated in later studies lapierre swain lapkin 

further theoretical developments and experimentation
the role of output in learning encourages to process language on a deeper level with more mental effort learner is in 
control our focus on output may be looking at how learners can play more responsible active roles in learning 
stretching their inter language to meet communicative goals in producing learner discovers what they can and cannot do 
as production requires them to create linguistic form and meaning complete grammatical processing as such output could 
have an important role in morphology and syntax production this role underlies the following three hypothesized 
functions of output which relate to accuracy rather than fluency noticing triggering function consciousness raising 
role hypothesis testing function meta linguistic function reflective role
swain and lapkin argue that producing output promotes noticing an argument supported by evidence from immersion 
children schmidt frota propose a notice the gap principle which states that second language learners will starting 
acquiring native like proficiency only if the native like form features in comprehended input and noticed ie noticed 
consciously swain lapkin claim that output produced subvocally or vocally may being to the learners attention what 
they do not know or know partially and some of their linguistic problems because it prompts learners to notice a gap 
between what they want to say and what they can say according to swain lapkin this may trigger cognitive processes 
which can generate linguistic knowledge that is new for the learner or that consolidate their existing knowledge 
swain

producing output is a way of testing hypotheses about linguistic well formedness or comprehensibility the output can 
taken to be the hypothesis itself best guess much research and theorizing has suggested that output particularly that 
which is erroneous can indicate that a learner has formulated a hypothesis about how language works and it testing it 
but this output can sometimes invoke feedback that prompts the learner to modify or reprocess their output
also the fact that learners only modify their speech in some cases indicates that they are only testing some 
things or hypotheses and not others the modified or reprocessed output can be considered to represent the leading edge 
of a learners inter language teacher feedback could be very useful in attending to this leading edge

in producing output learners reflect on their own second language use and their hypotheses thereby explicitly 
hypothesizing and their output allows them to control and internalize linguistic knowledge studies have been conducted 
to investigate this featuring tasks prompting reflection on language form while also involving conveying meaning 
the following studies having been conducted in immersion classes the tasks presented here required learners to produce 
meaningful output the content of which was language form and its relation to the meaning they are trying to express the 
lapierre study three grade eight early immersion classes over a period of approximately a month text reconstruction 
task which prompted them to discuss the accuracy of the second language they used the results suggest that negotiating 
about language form in the context of a meaning based task and reaching a solution constitutes output that promotes 
second language learning
